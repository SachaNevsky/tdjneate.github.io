                <h1>About Inker</h1>
                
                Inker is a prototype tool for people with aphasia to create constrained visual art. This version is for demonstration purposes for the <a href="https://assets20.sigaccess.org/">ASSETS 2020</a>
                conference, where the work is presented as a poster. The paper related to the poster, 'Painting a Picture of Accessible Digital Art' is available via the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3373625.3418019">ACM</a> and via <a href="https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/24769/1/">City's Open Access portal</a>. A video summarising Inker is embedded below.

                <h1>Explainer and Usage Instructions</h1>

Inker uses the colour information from a selected source image to support visual creativity. The drawing canvas is overlaid on the source image. When using Inker, a user draws by pressing down a finger or stylus on the drawing canvas. The colour of the brush is then matched to the colour at the same position in the underlying image. Drawing with this colour is then done in one of two modes:               
                <ul>
                    <li><b> Inking</b> uses a standard drawing algorithm, with a circular brush. Brush thickness is controlled with a slider</li>
                    <li><b> Rubbing</b> enables the user to place shapes of varying sizes around the canvas. The user selects brush shape (circles or squares) and uses sliders to control the size of the brush (Rubbing Shape Size) and the speed at which shapes are placed (Rubbing Speed). This effect is analogous to spray painting with specific shapes, whose colour is determined by the original artwork.</li>
